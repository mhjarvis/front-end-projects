## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce adding an overlay color. 

I also tried a new method to help organize my media queries by applying them inline. It seems there is some controversy about how best to apply these, but really appreciated the approach used by Ben Frain: https://benfrain.com/inline-or-combined-media-queries-in-sass-fight/
