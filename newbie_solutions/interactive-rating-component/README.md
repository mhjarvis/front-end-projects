### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I attempted to add in some of the components suggested from previous feedbacks - such as the picture element. I still need to work on forms and understanding all of the parts that go with it. I'm also trying to work on nameing classes/ids/variables better, as this remains one of my frustrations. 

### Continued development

- Form elements - I need to dive into learning what all the different parts do and how they work together. 

- Naming variables/classes/etc - This still feels sloppy and need to look into some additional resources; using semantic html also needs refinement.
