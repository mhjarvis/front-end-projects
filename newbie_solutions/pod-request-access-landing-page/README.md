### What I learned

1. One issue I was having when creating smaller components was how to make it responsive so that it would adjust even when the window went below the lowwest height/width. One approach I found via https://xavortm.com/responsive-containers-in-css/:

Instead of using fixed height/width, such as:

  .container {
    height: 600px;
    width: 375px;
    background-image: url('someimage.png');
    background-size: cover;
  }

We can use this approach to help resize content: 

  .container {
    height: 600px;
    width: 100%;
    width: 375px;
    background-image: url('someimage.png');
    background-size: cover;
  }

### Useful resources

- [Reponive Containers in CSS](https://xavortm.com/responsive-containers-in-css/) - Good article on how to create responsive containers - something that has been stumbling me for a while. This article seemed to reinforce it.
