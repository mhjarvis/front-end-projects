                <p class="main-info">
                A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a 
                healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, 
                such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced 
                fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, 
                strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for 
                five days a week.

            Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for 
            every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in 
            certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
